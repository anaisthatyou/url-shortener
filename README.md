What LOLS! What Larks! How Memorable! Much Cockatoo! So Wow!

In this kata, we're going to build our own human readable Url generator. Be creative with your source data. Make some really memorable Urls.

We're going to make a program that shortens Urls for us.

### Story 1 - Generate readable Urls
As a user
I want to generate a human readable Url
So that people can remember it

### Story 2 - Urls must not conflict
As a user
When I generate a Url
It should not conflict with previously generated Urls

(Think about running your code in a loop and maintaining state)

### Story 3 - Urls must not be rude
As a user
When I generate a Url
It should be funny, but not offensive
